    <h3><b>Dubrovnik</b></h3>
      <p><i>24 / 05 / 2018</i></p>
      <p>This is a city which I've been wanting to visit for a while. Initially, my boyfriend and I were going to travel around Croatia in 2017. Then we were invited for a wedding this year and decided to delay our plans and come back in 2018. With the wedding held in Hvar, we decided to island hop in the days leading up to the wedding. This included two days in Dubrovnik and 24hrs on Mljet Island (which I will write about in a separate post).</p>

      <p>Evening walk around the wall. I'd recommend going at 6pm, the temperatures are comfortable and the wall less crowded.</p>
      <p>What a city! I have finally seen the city wall and red roof tiles and can say that, yes, they are as beautiful as in the pictures. It's even more special with sun warming your back and the cooling ocean breeze. After walking almost the entirety of the wall, we stopped at the top bar with an ocean view. My boyfriend had a cooling beer and I a refreshing juice mixed from seven different types of fruits - it was divine.</p>

      <p>The Old Town is only a small place and you quickly get a sense of your surroundings. It's so charming and medieval-looking, unlike any other city I've been to, except from perhaps Tallinn, but still, completely different. The restaurants dished up the most incredible seafood, including an octopus salad I'm still dreaming of.</p>

      <p>We visited late May, a month which I'd recommend going. It wasn't as touristy as it gets later in the summer, and the temeperatures were comfortable although a little hot for me, but I've grown up with Arctic coldness. A taxi driver told me that temperatures can reach 40C in July and August.</p>
